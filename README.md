---BETTY MOVIE DATABASE (BMDB) ---

My first app - a quick tool for randomly choosing 3 films from a preset list based on a selected category in order to help you decide what to watch tonight. 

Users can also search for a new film to add to the database by title, pulling through the film's release poster, release date and synopsis from The Movie Database API (https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started)

During the building and deployment of this app has allowed I have been using the following:

- Flask
- Jinja
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- PostgreSQL
- APIs

Future updates to come will include user accounts/authentication for storing separate film lists and improved error handling.
